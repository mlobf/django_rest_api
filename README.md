    What is an API?

    Application Programming Interface.

    Why use/  build an API.
        API only send and recived data using json format.
        Thats allows you to send and receive data and integrate with multiple services.
        As matter of proporse, one rest service can provide integration to mobile, web apps, or both
        Because thats all you really care... getting data or submitting data to that service.

 return JsonResponse(data, safe=False) -> This allow you use a list instead a dictionary
